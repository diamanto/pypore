Pypore
=======

This project is for translocation event finding/analysis.
The aim is to use only free tools, so it can be used/contributed to by anyone.
It's written in Python, with numpy/scipy as a matlab replacement.
The gui library is pyside, and pyqtgraph is used for plotting.
More information can be found `here <http://parkin.github.io/pypore>`_.

**Note** that Pypore/PyporeGui are pre-alpha, major changes can happen at any time.

Pull requests are `welcome! <https://github.com/parkin/pypore>`_
