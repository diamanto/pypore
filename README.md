# TranslocationCode-Python
This project is for translocation event finding/analysis.  The aim is to use only free tools, so it can be used/contributed to by anyone.  It's written in Python, with numpy/scipy as a matlab replacement.  The gui library is pyqt, and pyqwt is used for plotting.

# Running
To run, in shell do './eventanalysis'

# TODO
* Finish on-analyze
* Put in boxes for threshold (nA or noise based) and (positive or negative)
* Make the bigger to fit multiple plots
* Make it possible to choose different algorithms (event finding, etc.) or import your own.
