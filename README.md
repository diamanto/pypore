# TranslocationCode-Python
This project is for translocation event finding/analysis.  The aim is to use only free tools, so it can be used/contributed to by anyone.  It's written in Python, with numpy/scipy as a matlab replacement.  The gui library is pyside, and pyqtgraph is used for plotting.  More information can be found [here](http://parkin1.github.io/pypore).
