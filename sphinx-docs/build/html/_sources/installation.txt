Installation
============

Basic Installation Steps
--------------------------

The dependencies of :py:mod:`pypore` are:

#. `Python v2.7.+ <http://www.python.org/>`_
#. `Cython <http://cython.org/>`_
#. `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org/>`_
#. `NumPy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_
#. `PyTables <http://www.pytables.org/>`_

Additionally, the dependencies of :py:mod:`pyporegui` are:

#. `PySide <http://qt-project.org/wiki/PySide>`_
#. `PyQtGraph <http://www.pyqtgraph.org/>`_

These packages can be installed individually, but it is **strongly** recommended that you use a complete scientific Python distribution, especially on Windows and Mac OS X.

Recommended distributions are:

#. `Anaconda <https://store.continuum.io/cshop/anaconda>`_
#. `EPD <http://www.enthought.com/products/epd.php>`_
#. `Python(x,y) <http://code.google.com/p/pythonxy/>`_
#. `WinPython <http://code.google.com/p/winpython/>`_

These distributions ship with a bunch of widely-used python libraries. When installing one of these distributions, ensure that the above libraries are installed. 
`PyQtGraph <http://www.pyqtgraph.org/>`_ is the least likely library to ship with one of the distributions, so after installing a distribution, go to  
`PyQtGraph <http://www.pyqtgraph.org/>`_, which has binary installers.
